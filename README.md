# Titanic Survival Prediction | Logistic Regression

This project demonstrates an end-to-end **machine learning classification pipeline** using **Logistic Regression** to predict passenger survival on the Titanic.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on demographic and travel-related features.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Seaborn built-in Titanic dataset
- Exported as CSV for reproducibility and version control
- Target Variable: `survived` (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## 🔧 Key Steps
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature selection
- Train-test split
- Logistic Regression model training
- Performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 🎯 Outcome
Built a baseline classification model to understand survival patterns and evaluate Logistic Regression performance on real-world structured data.
